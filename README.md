# Analog-type

Typing test with analog features created in a single day for the [Wooting Computex Game Jam 2025](https://wootingkb.github.io/computex-game-jam25/) (and cause I wanted to try out [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)).

I recommend checking out the other projects in the Game Jam too!

## Stack
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* SolidJS
* Prettier

## Contributing
Since this is just a fun demo, I don't plan on maintaining it. However, feel free to fork it!
